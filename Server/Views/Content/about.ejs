          <p> I was born in Cayambe Ecuador on May 13 2002. From my kindergarten to my 7th grade I was close to my grandparents since my parents would spend their time working to give me a good quality life. At the age of twelve my parents decided to buy a house so we moved out from my grandparents house, for me that was the worst day I could ever go through due to the love I had for them. In June 2019 my parents gave me the opportunity to study in Canada so we started working on all the documents I needed for doing so.

      <p>When I arrive to Canada I started studying at Centennial College; however, the experience I went through at the beginning was pretty sad since I did not know anybody in this country, but as the time went going on I could meet people, some people became friends and nowadays on my 21's after I concluded my Software Engineer Technician Program at Centennial College I realized that web development is really interesting for me; therefore, I dedicate my time to code and watch videos related to web development programming. Besides, I would like to join to the job market as a Web Developer. Everyday I try to upgrade and learn by myself new mechanisms or new tools that will help me to earn experience and knowledge within the web-development lifecycle. Currently, I have gotten experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, React, etc. It is worth saying that web development is not the only knowledge I have. I also have experience using programming languages such as C#, Java, Python, MySQL and .NET.</p>

      <p>However, when I feel overwhelmed for coding bugs, erros or just life issues I try to occupy my mind doing other activities such as: visiting parks, going to the gym, hanging out with friend or playing videogames.
