  <h1 id="abotMe">About Me</h1>
  <p> I was born in Cayambe Ecuador on May 13 2002. Nowadays, on my 20's I use my free time to code and watch videos related to web development programming. My main focus for this year is to get a Software Engineer job since I studied and got a diploma in the Software Engineer field at Centennial College. Everyday I try to upgrade and learn by myself new mechanisms or new tools that will help me to earn experience and knowledge within the web-development lifecycle. Currently I have experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB, etc. However, web development is not the only knowledge I have. I also have experience using programming languages such as C#, Java, Python, MySQL and .NET.

  <p>I tried to live each day as if it were the last day of my life; therefore, when I feel overwhelmed for coding bugs, erros or just life issues I try to occupy my mind doing other tasks such as: visiting parks, going to the gym, hanging out with friend or playing videogames.
